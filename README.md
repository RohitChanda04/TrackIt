# TrackIt - Your go-to place for tracking all your applications and progress

## Problem Statement
Although we have Simplify where we can track our applications but I personally never used it for that purpose. Call me old-schooled but I preferred entering all my application details into a Google Sheet.

Why?

So that I could create my own custom columns and row nomenclature. I ended up entering **3434 applications** that I have filled out since the time I started applying to full-time positions. Yes, although daunting, that's the count till now. The market has been really bad. And I'm still not there.

This made me wonder what if there were a platform where the candidates could not only upload their application details but also could get personalized data analytics to track their rate, progress and calls-to-no-calls ratio. And so, I came up with this idea of ```TrackIt``` which could be a go-to platform for all candidates hunting for jobs to make their lives easier.
